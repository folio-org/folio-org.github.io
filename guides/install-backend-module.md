## Introduction

When the initial development of a new back-end (server-side) module is [established](/guidelines/create-new-repo/), and snapshot artifacts are being generated by the continuous integration, then it is able to be added to the folio-ansible configuration, and make it available in the folio-snapshot and folio-testing [reference environments](/guides/automation/#reference-environments).

There is a separate procedure to [install a new front-end module](/guides/install-frontend-module/).

(After the new module has been operating in snapshot and testing environments, and an initial release is ready to be made, then instead follow the [release procedures](/guidelines/release-procedures/#add-to-platforms).)

## Verify MD and required interfaces

First ensure that this new module's [ModuleDescriptor](/guides/module-descriptor/) is deployed and that any required interfaces are available.

For example, consider the `mod-notes` module.
Obtain its MD from the registry and extract the "requires" section:

```
curl -s -S -w'\n' \
  'http://folio-registry.aws.indexdata.com/_/proxy/modules?filter=mod-notes&latest=1&full=true' \
  | jq '.[].requires'
```

That shows that it requires various interfaces, including "`users 15.1`" and "`configuration 2.0`".

Now ensure that each needed interface version is available.
One method is to visit the [https://folio-snapshot.dev.folio.org/settings/about](https://folio-snapshot.dev.folio.org/settings/about) page.

## Ensure LaunchDescriptor

Ensure that this new module's [ModuleDescriptor](/guides/module-descriptor/) includes the Docker-based [LaunchDescriptor](/guides/module-descriptor/#launchdescriptor-properties).

Its properties will specify the memory allocation, whether this module utilises a database, and can document other environment variables, etc.

## Ensure local Docker

Ensure that the module will operate with a local Vagrant VM.

Follow the guide to verify [Local module as Docker container](/guides/run-local-folio/#local-module-as-docker-container).

## Declare new module

Prepare the Jira ticket to guide the process, and request that the new backend module be enabled for the snapshot and testing.
Also clarify if this module needs to be included in the "core" set of modules.

Specify "Development Team: FOLIO DevOps" to be prioritized and scheduled.

The DevOps team will configure the module and conduct various configuration tests.

## Verify deployment

After merge, await the scheduled build of the folio-snapshot and folio-testing [reference environments](/guides/automation/#reference-environments).

Visit the [Software versions](https://folio-snapshot.dev.folio.org/settings/about) page of each to verify that the new module is present.
