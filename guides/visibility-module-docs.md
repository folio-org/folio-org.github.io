## Introduction

There are many individual modules hosted at FOLIO GitHub.
The [Source-code map](/source/map/) lists every module, and links to its relevant related documentation.

This enables all developers to easily discover the information that they need, to be able to work with each module.

As explained in the FAQ [Where is developer documentation located](/faqs/where-is-developer-documentation-located/), one of the principles of FOLIO module development is that module documentation is managed along with its source code.

The [Source-code map](/source/map/) is automatically assembled, and so it requires some assistance to be able to gather the pieces.

The following sections provide some tips for module developers to improve the discoverability of their module documentation.
