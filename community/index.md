## Governance Model

Refer to the Wiki [FOLIO Governance Model](https://wiki.folio.org/display/COMMUNITY/FOLIO+Governance+Model).

## Engineering teams

The FOLIO developer community consists of:

- Index Data, which leads the technical development of the FOLIO
  software
- Several software engineering teams
- Contributing developers from the community
- Many supporting individuals whose contributions feed into and guide
  the development process

The following sections list the engineering roles and contacts for the various parts of
the project.  Team members can be contacted via the collaboration tools
listed above.
There is also the [FOLIO Developer Directory](https://wiki.folio.org/display/COMMUNITY/FOLIO+Developer+Directory) listing some developers and their general work areas.

### Engineering core team

The engineering core team sets the strategic direction for technical
architecture in the FOLIO software:

- Sebastian Hammer (project lead)
- Nassib Nassar (project lead - technical)
- Jakub Skoczen (technical project manager)
- Adam Dickmeiss
- Vince Bareau
- Peter Murray (community)

### Subproject core teams

Several components of the FOLIO software are distinct subprojects and
have a core team of software engineers with commit-level access to the
source code repositories.  Each subproject generally has a lead
developer who is responsible for selecting new core team members from
the community.

  Malconian, David Crossley
- mod-auth, mod-users: Kurt Nordstrom (lead)
