This is the home for developers building [FOLIO -- a new open source library
system](https://www.folio.org/).
"The Future of Libraries is Open".

At the heart of FOLIO is an open source, cloud-based application framework that
is designed to support collaboration among development teams.  It is also
designed to enable vendors, libraries, tenants, and users to configure their
experience to an unprecedented level.  We see FOLIO as an "innovation platform"
in which librarians and software developers can work together to imagine and
create new kinds of library services.

We invite developers with an interest in looking
under the hood at what is coming along, or even better, developers interested
in building it with us. We will be continually releasing code and
gradually adding features.  We can use help testing, exploring, and stretching
the platform.  You can help us shape the core of the system.

This website brings together the documentation and links that software
developers will need to participate in FOLIO.

We hope you will join FOLIO and help us shape the future of libraries!  We
invite you to provide feedback and explore ideas with us.  Join the
[community and conversation](community) over at [folio.org](https://www.folio.org/)

The FOLIO Project is [grateful](about/thanks) for the support of contributors,
other open source projects, and commercial providers.
