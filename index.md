## Welcome to FOLIO software development

This is the home for developers building [FOLIO, a new open source library
system](https://www.folio.org/).

At the heart of FOLIO is an open source, cloud-based application framework that
is designed to support collaboration among development teams.  It is also
designed to enable vendors, libraries, tenants, and users to configure their
experience to an unprecedented level.  We see FOLIO as an "innovation platform"
in which librarians and software developers can work together to imagine and
create new kinds of library services.

Who is the platform for at this stage?  Developers with an interest in looking
under the hood at what is coming along, or even better, developers interested
in building it with us.  Over the coming months, we will be releasing code and
gradually adding features.  We can use help testing, exploring, and stretching
the platform.  You can help us shape the core of the system.

This website brings together the documentation and links that software
developers will need to participate in FOLIO.  Though the website is still
nascent, we expect it to evolve quickly in the coming weeks.

We hope you will join FOLIO and help us shape the future of libraries!  We
invite you to provide feedback and explore ideas with us.  Join the
conversation over at [folio.org](https://www.folio.org/)
