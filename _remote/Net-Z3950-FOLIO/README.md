# z2folio - the Z39.50-to-FOLIO gateway

## Introduction

[`z2folio`](bin/z2folio) is a Z39.50 server for FOLIO bibliographic and holdings data, supporting record retrieval in USMARC, OPAC, XML and JSON formats. The functionality is all provided by [the `Net::Z3950::FOLIO` library](lib/Net/Z3950/FOLIO.pm), which is also part of this distribution. It is written in Perl, and follows standard Perl-module conventions.

The name of the Docker container is `mod-z3950`.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are defined in the [module descriptor](ModuleDescriptor.json) but since the FOLIO Z39.50 server is strictly a client to the rest of FOLIO it does not need to be installed as a part of FOLIO itself, and can run outside of a FOLIO installation provided it is pointing to an Okapi server with the following modules enabled:

* [`mod-graphql`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql)
* [`mod-search`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-search)
* [`mod-inventory`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-inventory)
* [`mod-inventory-storage`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-inventory-storage)
* [`mod-source-record-storage`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-source-record-storage)

Of these, the last three are fairly ubiquitous in FOLIO installations, but mod-graphql may need to be added.

The Okapi connection details (url, tenant, username, password) are defined in [the configuration file](etc/config.json) or via environment variables: see **Authentication** below.

## Installation

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

On some platforms (e.g. my MacBook running MacOS 10.13.6 with YAZ and libxml2 installed from Homebrew 1.8.4), installing the prerequisite SimpleServer with `cpan install Net::Z3950::SimpleServer` fails. I fixed it using:

    C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.9.4_3/include/libxml2 cpan install Net::Z3950::SimpleServer

## Running

If you don't want to install, you can run directly from the development checkout as:

    perl -I lib bin/z2folio -c etc/config -- -f etc/yazgfs.xml

## Building and running from Docker

    terminal1$ docker build -t zfolio .
    terminal1$ docker run -it --rm -p9997:9997 -e OKAPI_PASSWORD=swordfish --name run-zfolio zfolio

    terminal2$ yaz-client @:9997
    Z> find @attr 1=4 a
    Z> format opac
    Z> show 1

Note: if running in Kubernetes, it may be useful to turn of session logging by adding the `-v-session` parameter to the arguments. For example, `perl -I lib bin/z2folio -c etc/config -- -f etc/yazgfs.xml -v-session`. Session logs can be quite noisy on Kubernetes due to tcp healthchecks.

Docker containers get published as [folioorg/mod-z3950](https://hub.docker.com/r/folioorg/mod-z3950/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) and [folioci/mod-z3950](https://hub.docker.com/r/folioci/mod-z3950/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).

## Authentication

Whichever approach to running the server you prefer, the [default configuration file](etc/config.json) specifies that the password used to authenticate onto the back-end FOLIO system must be specified in the `FOLIO_PASSWORD` environment variable. You can provide that however seems best to you -- e.g. injecting it into a Docker container with the `-e name=value` as above -- or indeed use a different configuration file that hardwires the credentials.

## Access via SRU

Thanks to the magic of the protocol-polyglot [YAZ GFS](https://software.indexdata.com/yaz/doc/server.html), the FOLIO Z39.50 server also serves the SRU (REST-like) and SRW (SOAP-based) protocols. For example, if running the server on your local host, you can use the following to obtain an XML-formatted OPAC record containing both bibliographic metadata in MARCXML format and holdings-and-item information such as might be used by an OPAC. Replace placeholder <dbname> with the real database name (or tenant id).

    http://localhost:9997/<dbname>?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=title=a&maximumRecords=1&recordSchema=opac

## Troubleshooting

If when you perform a search your Z39.50 client reports

> Cannot query field "search_instances" on type "Query".

The problem is that the back-end FOLIO service you are searching in does not have `mod-search` (ElasticSearch-based searching in inventory), which was first released in FOLIO R1-2021 (Iris). In this case, you should configure the Z39.50 server to use the older approach of searching directly in `mod-inventory-storage`. You can most easily do this by changing the `graphqlQuery` entry in [`etc/config.json`](etc/config.json) from "mod-search.graphql-query" to "instances.graphql-query". Note, however, that as of FOLIO R2-2022 (Morning Glory), searching directly in inventory will no longer work for full-text searches such as author and title, only for exact-value searches such as HRID and ISBN.
