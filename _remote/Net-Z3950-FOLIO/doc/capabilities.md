## Overview

The FOLIO Z39.50 server is [a FOLIO module](https://github.com/folio-org/Net-Z3950-FOLIO)) that provides access to the inventory information of a FOLIO tenant (bibliographic, holdings and item-level) by means of [the ANSI/NISO Z39.50 protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z39.50) that is in widespread use in libraries and ILL solutions. Because it is based on [the YAZ Generic Frontend Server](https://software.indexdata.com/yaz/doc/server.html), it also supports [the REST-like SRU standard](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/) and [its SOAP-based equivalent SRW](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/companionSpecs/srw.html).

The server is implemented as a Perl module, [`Net::Z3950::FOLIO`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Z3950::FOLIO), which is available on CPAN (the Perl software repository) like any other Perl module. (Perl was chosen because [the `Net::Z3950::SimpleServer` module](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Z3950::SimpleServer) makes it so much easier to implement a Z39.50 server than in other languages.)

The behaviour of the Z39.50 server is driven in part by [a configuration file](from-pod/Net-Z3950-FOLIO-Config.md). The server is distributed with [a standard configuration](../etc/config.json) which specifies things like how to determine what FOLIO service to access, where to find the GraphQL query that extracts holdings information, and how Z39.50 queries are mapped into the CQL queries that FOLIO uses. It is possible to run the server with a different configuration, but this document describes capabilities such as the supported searches under the assumption that the standard configuration is in use. Standard disclaimers apply.



## Server deployment

Since the FOLIO Z39.50 server is strictly a client to the rest of FOLIO (it uses `mod-graphql` and `mod-source-record-storage`), it does not need to be installed as a part of FOLIO itself, and can run outside of a FOLIO installation provided it is furnished with the credentials for a user with all necessary permissions. However, it will typically be run as a FOLIO module itself, described by the provided [module descriptor](../ModuleDescriptor.json) and packaged to run as a container by the provided [Docker file](../Dockerfile) (see [below](#running-under-docker)).

When using the standard configuration file (see above), it is necessary to provide four pieces of information as environment variables:

* `OKAPI_URL` &mdash; the URL of the Okapi service to contact for GraphQL and SRS services, i.e. the FOLIO whose inventory is to be accessed.
* `OKAPI_TENANT` &mdash; the tenant to use on that Okapi URL. (This is presently hardwired at configuration time, but in future will be taken from the Z39.50 database name.)
* `OKAPI_USER` &mdash; the user to act as: note that this user will need permissions to access GraphQL, inventory and SRS.
* `OKAPI_PASSWORD` &mdash; the password used to authenticate as the nominated user.

For example:

	env OKAPI_URL=https://indexdata-test-okapi.folio.indexdata.com \
	    OKAPI_TENANT=indexdata \
	    OKAPI_USER=id_admin \
	    OKAPI_PASSWORD=swordfish \
	    perl -I lib bin/z2folio -c etc/config.json -- -f etc/yazgfs.xml

By default, the server listens on port 9997 (using the same port for all three supported protocols). If necessary, this can be changed by editing [the YAZ GFS configuration file](../etc/yazgfs.xml): see [the documentation](https://software.indexdata.com/yaz/doc/server.vhosts.html) for details.

### Running under Docker

FOLIO modules are typically run as Docker containers. When running the Z39.50 server in this fashion, it is necessary to inject environment variables into the container to specify the FOLIO URL, tenant, etc. This is most conveniently done using Docker's `-e NAME=VALUE` command-line option:

	docker run -it --rm -p9997:9997 \
		-e OKAPI_URL=https://indexdata-test-okapi.folio.indexdata.com \
		-e OKAPI_TENANT=indexdata \
		-e OKAPI_USER=id_admin \
		-e OKAPI_PASSWORD=swordfish \
		--name run-zfolio zfolio

Note that this invocation also plumbs the container-internal TCP port 9997, where the server listens, to the host system's port 9997.

If it is necessary to provide a different main configuration file or YAZ GFS configuration, these can be injected into the Docker container as "volumes" using [the `--volume=hostFile:containerFile` command-line option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems):

	docker run --volume=localConfig.json:etc/config.json



## Z39.50

As a Z39.50 server, the software supports the following services:

* [Init](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/04.html#3.2.1.1), including authentication and diagnostics (see [below](#z3950-authentication))
* [Search](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/04.html#3.2.2.1), with support for Bath profile queries (see [below](#z3950-searching))
* [Present](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/04.html#3.2.3.1) in USMARC, OPAC and XML formats (see [below](#z3950-retrieval))
* [Sort](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.7.1)
* [Delete](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.4.1)
* [Trigger Resource Control](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.6.2)

[Scan](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.8.1)
is a possible feature for future versions.
There are presently no plans to support
[Extended Services](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/06.html#3.2.9.1),
[Explain](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/07.html#3.2.10)
or the unloved
[Close](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/08.html#3.2.11.1)
service.

(The
[Segment](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/04.html#3.2.3.2),
[Access Control](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.5.1),
[Resource Control](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.6.1),
and
[Resource-report](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/markup/05.html#3.2.6.3)
services are not supported by the underlying SimpleServer library, so there is no realistic prospect of supporting them in the FOLIO server; but there is no evidence that any client exists that can use these services.)


### Z39.50 authentication

If no default username and password are specified in the server's configuration, or if the user has reason to want to authenticate onto FOLIO as a different user, these tokens can be provided in the Z39.50 Init request as a single "open" authentication string, separated by a forward slash (`/`). (In the YAZ command-line client, this can be done using the command `auth user/pass`. If authentication onto FOLIO is rejected &mdash; because of incorrect tokens or for any other reason &mdash; the Z39.50 server will reject the Init request, with the response including a diagnostic `otherInfo` unit.

Here's how that looks using the YAZ command-line client:

	Z> open @:9997
	Connecting...OK.
	Sent initrequest.
	Connection rejected by v3 target.
	ID     : 81/81
	Name   : z2folio gateway/GFS/YAZ
	Version: 1.2/5.30.3 2af59bc45cf4508d5c84f350ee99804c4354b3b3
	Init response contains 1 otherInfo unit:
	  1: otherInfo unit contains 1 diagnostic:
	    1: code=1014 (Init/AC: Authentication System error),
		addinfo='Password does not match'
	Z> auth mike/swordfish
	Authentication set to Open (mike/swordfish)
	Z> open @:9997
	Connecting...OK.
	Sent initrequest.
	Connection accepted by v3 target.
	ID     : 81/81
	Name   : z2folio gateway/GFS/YAZ
	Version: 1.2/5.30.3 2af59bc45cf4508d5c84f350ee99804c4354b3b3
	Options: search present delSet triggerResourceCtrl sort namedResultSets
	Z>

Usually, the Z39.50 server will be configured to default to logging in as a specified user (see the discussion of `OKAPI_USER` and `OKAPI_PASSWORD` [above](#server-deployment)).


### Z39.50 searching

The FOLIO Z39.50 server supports all boolean operations (AND, OR, ANDNOT) nested to arbitrary depths.

The standard configuration supports searching on the following use attributes (type 1):

* **1.** Personal name. Same as 1003.
* **4.** Title.
* **7.** ISBN.
* **8.** ISSN.
* **12.** Local number. Interpreted as HRID (human-readable identifier).
* **21.** Subject heading.
* **31.** Date of publication. **Does not work** with the present inventory module, as it does not support this search.
* **1003.** Author. Interpreted as contributors
* **1016.** Any. Interpreted as a search on FOLIO's "keyword" index. This includes title, contributors and identifiers.
* **1019.** Record source. Interpreted as the inventory's "source" index, which is "marc" for MARC records stored in SRS.
* **1108.** DC-Source. Same as 1019.
* **1155.** Sources of Data. Same as 1019.
* **1211.** OCLC Number. **Does not work** with the present inventory module.
* **9998.** A non-standard access-point used for searching by the barcode of items.
* **9999.** A special non-standard access-point that searches contributors, title, HRID and subjects. This is similar to the set of fields indexed as "keyword" (access-point 1016), but implemented as a four-way OR, so less efficient (but more inclusive).

When no access-point is specified for a term, that term is searched for in the "keyword" index by default, i.e. finding title, contributors and identifiers.

The following relation attributes (type 2) are supported:

* **1.** Less than
* **2.** Less than or equal
* **3.** Equal
* **4.** Greater or equal
* **5.** Greater than
* **6.** Not equal
* **100.** Phonetic
* **101.** Stem
* **102.** Relevance

The following position attributes (type 3) are supported:

* **1.** First in field
* **2.** First in subfield. Same as 1.
* **3.** Any position in field.

All structure attributes (type 4) are ignored

The following truncation attributes (type 5) are supported:

* **1.** Right truncation
* **2.** Left truncation
* **3.** Left and right
* **100.** Do not truncate
* **101.** Process # in search term
* **104.** Z39.58 (CCL-style masking)

The following completeness attributes (type 6) are supported:

* **1.** Incomplete subfield
* **2.** Complete subfield. Same as 3.
* **3.** Complete field

**NOTE.** "Support" here means that the Z39.50 server generates the correct CQL query to express the Z39.50 query using these attributes: the FOLIO back-end does not necessarily support all the CQL queries &mdash; for example, stemming is not supported in the back-end; but if and when it is, it will be accessible via Z39.50.


### Z39.50 retrieval

Records can be retrieved in the following record syntaxes:

* **JSON** (1.2.840.10003.5.1000.81.3) &mdash; The entire composite record, as obtained from mod-graphql, is returned as-is. Since all the other forms of the record that can delivered are derived from this, it can be a useful way to see the Real Truth that those records are versions of.
* **XML** (1.2.840.10003.5.109.10) &mdash; Three different schemas are supported (expressed in Z39.50 terms as element-set names):
  * `raw` &mdash; a literal, mechanical transliteration of the JSON data into XML. Can be useful as the input to further XSLT transformations.
  * `usmarc` &mdash; the standard [MARCXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/) representation of a USMARC record in XML.
  * `opac` &mdash; the [YAZ toolkit](https://www.indexdata.com/yaz/)'s de-facto standard representation of a Z39.50 OPAC record in XML, including the bibliographic data expressed as MARCXML alongside holdings and item-level information.
* **USMARC** (1.2.840.10003.5.10) &mdash; ISO 2709-encoded USMARC records. The element-set names `f` and `b` are supported, and are both equivalent. Other element-set names are reserved for future expansion.
* **OPAC** (1.2.840.10003.5.102) &mdash; [the Z39.50 OPAC record format](https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/asn1.html#RecordSyntax-opac).



### Z39.50 sorting

The Z39.50 Sort service is supported as follows:

* Only one result-set can be sorted at once, i.e. the service cannot be used to merge multiple result sets.
* "Generic" sorting is supported; "database-specific" sorting is not.
* Within each sort key:
  * Sort-fields can be specified as a sort-attribute of type 1 (use attribute) with value corresponding to the field to sort on. These values are the same as for use attributes when searching.
  * Relations 0 (ascending) and 1 (descending) are supported. Relations 3 (ascending by frequency) and 4 (descending by frequency) are not.
  * Cases 0 (case-sensitive) and 1 (case-insensitive) are supported.
  * Missing-value specifications 1 (fail) and 2 (null value) are supported. Value 3 (treat missing as a specified value) is not.

So, for example, the YAZ command-line client comment `sort 1=4 s< 1=21 i>` will sort first by title, case-insensitively in ascending order, then by HRID, case-sensitively in descending order.

**NOTE.** As with searching, "support" here means that the Z39.50 server generates the correct CQL query to express the Z39.50 query using these attributes: the FOLIO back-end does not necessarily support all the CQL queries. Where a given index does not support some of the sort-index modifiers that it ought, these can be explicitly omitted using [the `omitSortIndexModifiers` configuration option](from-pod/Net-Z3950-FOLIO-Config.md#omitSortIndexModifiers).



## SRU

[The SRU standard](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/) is a recasting of Z39.50-like semantics into a more web-friendly format, in which requests are expressed as HTTP URLs with specific query parameters, and responses are XML documents. Unlike Z39.50, it is stateless: each request is self-contained and does not depend on earlier operations. As a result, it has no concept of session initialization, and no result sets: each request is its own search and immediately returns the relevant records. A typical SRU request looks like this:

http://lehigh-z3950-test.folio.indexdata.com:9997/sru/TEST?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=title=a&maximumRecords=1&recordSchema=opac

When building new clients to integrate with this server, SRU may be easier to use than Z39.50 because it is defined as in terms of XML and HTTP, a format and protocol for which there are many libraries available in many languages.


### SRU authentication

As with Z39.50 authentication, the default username and password are wired into the server's configuration, but these can be overridden by individual requests.

[The SRU specification](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/) does not specify a way to communicate a username and password to an SRU server; and although there is [an authentication extension](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/extensions/authentication.html), it too is silent on application-level username/password pairs, instead focussing on IP-based authentication, HTTP Basic authentication, the use of HTTPS, and opaque authentication tokens. YAZ-based SRU servers, then, adopt the convention of using the `x-username` and `x-password` extension parameters to convey a username and password. For example:

http://lehigh-z3950-test.folio.indexdata.com:9997/sru/TEST?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=title=a&maximumRecords=1&recordSchema=opac&x-username=mike&x-password=swordfish


### SRU searching

In SRU, the query is expressed as CQL, the same query language that FOLIO uses internally. The FOLIO SRU server therefore passes the query straight through to the back-end, and all CQL queries that work in FOLIO's inventory instances store will work in CQL. (The `indexMap` part of the configuration file is therefore not used when serving SRU requests.)

To see some of the CQL searches that are supported on the FOLIO back-end, see the values corresponding to the BIB-1 use attributes in the `indexMap` part of [the standard configuration](../etc/config.json): for example, `item.barcode=14120137` can be used to search for bibliographic records of instances that have an item with the specific barcode.

### SRU retrieval

In SRU, all records are returned in XML. The following schemas are supported (specified as the `recordSchema` parameter):

* `raw` &mdash; a literal, mechanical transliteration of the entire composite JSON record, as obtained from mod-graphql.
* `usmarc` &mdash; the standard [MARCXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/) representation of a USMARC record in XML.
* `opac` &mdash; the [YAZ toolkit](https://www.indexdata.com/yaz/)'s de-facto standard representation of a Z39.50 OPAC record in XML, including the bibliographic data expressed as MARCXML alongside holdings and item-level information.



## SRW

[SRW](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/companionSpecs/srw.html) is a binding of the SRU semantics onto [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)-based transport. It is not widely used, but is nevertheless also supported by the FOLIO Z39.50 server.

As with SRU, CQL queries are passed straight through to FOLIO; all records are returned in XML format, and the `raw`, `usmarc` and `opac` schemas are supported.
