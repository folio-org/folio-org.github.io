# Date-time values must comply with IETF RFC-3339

## Summary

* Validation of date-time values must assert compliance with IETF RFC-3339.
* Date-time values in storage must be compliant with IETF RFC-3339 Section 5.6.
* APIs must respect date-time values when retrieving a range of values by date-time in a query.

## Motivation

Compliance with [IETF RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) as stated in our ["Working with dates and times" documentation](https://dev.folio.org/guides/dates-and-times/).

## Detailed Explanation/Design

Code that validates date-time values must do so in accordance with [IETF RFC-3339 Section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6).

Date-time values at rest must be fully compliant with [IETF RFC-3339 Section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6).

Code that handles date-time values must respect all aspects of such values, including but not limited to their `time-offset` attributes. For example, an API that retrieves entries in a given date-time range must return the same results given any of the following arguments:

* `2023-10-05T12:51:12.000-04:00` and `2023-10-06T12:51:12.000-04:00`
* `2023-10-05T16:51:12.000Z` and `2023-10-06T16:51:12.000Z`
* `2023-10-05T11:51:12.000-05:00` and `2023-10-06T18:51:12.000+02:00`

## Risks and Drawbacks

Existing documentation states that, "The APIs assume UTC on input, and store and return timestamps in UTC". Thus, APIs may assume date-time values without a `time-offset` attributes are UTC, which may be incorrect given that ISO-8601 states that [when no UTC offset is provided, "the time is assumed to be in local time"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Local_time_(unqualified)).

Some APIs may accept date-time values that lack a time-offset attribute. For such APIs, this will be a breaking change.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This RFC aims to increase the clarity and precision of our guidance while at the same time bringing it into compliance with IETF RFC-3339.

## Unresolved Questions

None. Long live IETF RFC-3339.
