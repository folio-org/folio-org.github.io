## Introduction

This document defines the checklists for creating and reviewing various types of [pull-request](/search-other/#github) (PR).

Also refer to [Development, design, and review processes](/guidelines/development-design-review/)
and to the additional Wiki [Pull Request Guidelines](https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Pull+Request+Guidelines).

## Backend pull request checklist

* Do the changes meet the intended purpose described in the feature or story?
* Do the tests reflect the change in behaviour?
  * Do the tests describe scenarios that are described in the story or feature?
  * Do the tests describe common failure or validation scenarios?
* Has the API changed? (If yes, refer to the interface change [checklist](#interface-change-checklist).)
  * Is the change compatibility breaking? (link to guidance) If yes, refer to the breaking interface change [checklist](#interface-compatibility-breaking-change-checklist).
* Does the change alter or remove existing requests to other modules, or introduce new requests? (If yes, refer to external requests / dependencies [checklist](#external-requests--dependencies-checklist).)
* Do the automated checks pass (e.g. tests, sonar, lint)?
* Does each PR title reference a Jira issue for the correct project (at the beginning of the title)?
  * See the additional requirements at Wiki [Pull Request Guidelines](https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Pull+Request+Guidelines).
  * Note that the Jira ticket identifier slug must be upper-case with no spaces (e.g. `FOLIO-2951`).
  * Does that Jira ticket have a "Fix Version"?
* Should the implementation version change (link to guidance)?
* Are any of the library dependencies a snapshot or pre-release version?

## Interface change checklist

* Do the API description checks pass (e.g. [api-lint](/guides/api-lint/))?
* Do the JSON Schema checks pass (e.g. [api-schema-lint](/guides/describe-schema/))?
* Has the interface version been updated?
  * In the ModuleDescriptor?
  * In the interface definition?
* Do new properties follow standards and [conventions](/guidelines/naming-conventions/) (see guidance)?
  * Does the name describe the property specifically?
  * Is the name formatted correctly (e.g. camel case)?
  * Do they use the correct types (e.g. ID references should be [UUIDs](/guides/uuids/))?
  * Are server derived properties marked as read-only?
  * Does a new JSON object disallow additional properties?
  * Have the examples that are used in the RAML been updated?
  * Have the sample / reference records been updated?
* Do new endpoints follow standards and [conventions](/guidelines/naming-conventions/) (see guidance)?
  * Is the path formatted correctly (e.g. hyphens separating words)?
  * Is the endpoint nested within another resource appropriately?
  * Does the endpoint have its own permission in the ModuleDescriptor?
  * Does that permission exist in the `[module-name].all` (e.g. `circulation.all`) permission set?
  * Does the endpoint have the correct module permissions?
  * Are there sample or reference records for the new endpoint?
* Does the change fit in an existing interface or should a new interface be provided?
  * Is the current interface too large?
  * Do parts of the interface have different reasons to change?
  * Is a new endpoint experimental?

## Interface compatibility breaking change checklist

**Note**: Only merge the breaking change pull request when all other compatibility pull requests are also ready to be merged.

* Clearly mark the pull request as "`Do not merge`" (i.e. in PR title and description, by Label, or both) until all related PRs are ready.
* Identify modules dependent upon the changed interface:
  * Using the relevant "Release planning spreadsheet". These are pinned in the [Slack](/guidelines/which-forum/#slack) `#releases` channel.
  * Using python script for checking against an existing environment, e.g. [interface-dependents](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-tools/tree/master/interface-dependents).
* Are there Jira issues in the relevant project for each dependent module?
  * Do they contain the appropriate level of detail? Which endpoints/schemas changed, etc.
  * Do they block the issue which introduces the breaking change?
* Are the Jira tickets under active development?
  * If not, contact the project's PO and make sure that they are aware of the urgency.
* Are pull requests raised to make each impacted module be compatible?
  * Have they been approved?

## External requests / dependencies checklist

Use this when changes are made to a dependent interface, either when:
* New features (e.g. new properties) of that interface are used;
* Requests are added to, or removed from, the implementation of an endpoint;
* Changes are needed for a breaking compatibility change in the interface.

Checklist:
* Has the interface version been updated in the ModuleDescriptor?
  * Is it at least the interface version where the feature was introduced?
  * If the new version is a major change, can dual support be offered?
* Are the dependent interface versions provided by another module?
* Are the correct module permissions expressed on each endpoint that uses the interface?
