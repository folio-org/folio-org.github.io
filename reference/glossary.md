## FOLIO Components

### Okapi

The FOLIO middleware and API gateway. Okapi serves as the foundation
layer for managing FOLIO apps and services. For more information, see
the [Okapi Guide and Reference](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md).

### Stripes

The FOLIO UI toolkit. The Stripes toolkit provides a means of building
web applications that expose the functionality of underlying Okapi
modules. For more information, see the
[Stripes GitHub repository](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes).

### Stripes entities

The document
[Stripes entities: packages, modules, apps and more](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/modules-apps-etc.md)
is a summary of terms used in that context, e.g. component, package, module, app, plugin.

### Okapi-Stripes Platform, LSP Base, LSP Extended

The "Okapi-Stripes Platform" and the "FOLIO LSP Base" and the "FOLIO LSP Extended Apps" are [defined](https://wiki.folio.org/x/kozc).

([APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface))
are well-defined interfaces through which interactions happen.

#### App Store

designed to support the installation of both free and commercial
modules and applications through an App Store.

#### AWS/ECS

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the
[Amazon EC2 Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is a
cloud-based application deployment platform from Amazon. FOLIO is
designed to play well in the cloud.

#### BIBFRAME

#### CC

The [FOLIO Community Council](https://wiki.folio.org/display/CC/)

#### CQL

Contextual Query Language
([CQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Query_Language)).
It was previously known as Common Query Language,
and that is not to be confused with the
[OGC](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html)
language of the same name.

Some starting points are:

- [A Gentle Introduction to CQL](http://zing.z3950.org/cql/intro.html) (incomplete, outdated, explains features not supported by FOLIO).
- FOLIO [CQL to PostgreSQL JSON converter](https://github.com/folio-org/raml-module-builder#cql-contextual-query-language) (CQL2PgJSON).
- FOLIO FAQ [Explain CQL string matching](/faqs/explain-cql/)
- The [CQL-1.2](https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/) specification and context sets.
- As [SRU](#sru) 2.0 is OASIS searchRetrieve Version 1.0, then CQL is its
  [Part 5](https://docs.oasis-open.org/search-ws/searchRetrieve/v1.0/os/part5-cql/searchRetrieve-v1.0-os-part5-cql.html).
- [CQL-Java](https://www.indexdata.com/resources/software/cql-java/).
- The CQL parser in [YAZ](https://software.indexdata.com/yaz/doc/tools.html#cql).

A CQL example:
```
(username=="ab*" or personal.firstName=="ab*" or personal.lastName=="ab*")
and active=="true" sortby personal.lastName personal.firstName barcode
```

For other relevant CQL examples see the FOLIO items above, and the [API docs](/reference/api/), and the debug output for tests in each backend module.
