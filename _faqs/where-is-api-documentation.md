All [API documentation](/reference/api/) is available on-line.

This is automatically generated from each back-end module's source API description files (RAML and OpenAPI OAS) and JSON Schemas.
This happens [during](/reference/api/#generated-during-ci) continuous integration whenever that module's sources are merged to its master branch.
