When a new module has been commenced and its artifacts are being deployed by CI, then follow the guides [Install a new front-end module to a platform](/guides/install-frontend-module/) and [Install a new back-end module](/guides/install-backend-module/) (and edge modules) to add to snapshot reference environment builds.

After the new module has been operating in snapshot reference environments, and an initial release is ready to be made, then instead follow the [release procedures](/guidelines/release-procedures/#add-to-platforms).
