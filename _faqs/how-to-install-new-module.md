When a new module has been commenced and its artifacts are being deployed, follow the guides to [Install a new front-end module to a platform](/guides/install-frontend-module/) and [Install a new back-end module](/guides/install-backend-module/) for snapshot and testing builds.

After the new module has been operating in snapshot and testing environments, and an initial release is ready to be made, then instead follow the [release procedures](/guidelines/release-procedures/#add-to-platforms).
