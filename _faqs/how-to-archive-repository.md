## Introduction

If a repository is no longer maintained, and a decision has been made to archive the repository, then follow this procedure.

(**Note**: If the repository is to be **renamed** rather than archived, then there are various ramifications.
Tread very carefully and follow the guide [Rename a module](/guides/rename-module/) instead.)

## Retain repository name

While following these "archive" instructions, then under no circumstances can the repository be renamed (e.g. to mod-foo-deprecated, or some such).

The existing name must be retained. Its artifacts are utilised in past releases.

## Raise a Jira ticket

Create a Jira ticket for the project of this module, so that everyone can be aware of what happened to the repository.

Certain operations will require Admin access to the repository.
Please complete all tasks that you have sufficient permissions for, then ask at Slack #devops channel.
Better still, ensure that the relevant team that will be doing the work, does have Admin access.

## Ensure not in a Platform

Ensure that this module is not in a Stripes Platform,
i.e. search in the [platform-complete install.json](https://github.com/folio-org/platform-complete/blob/snapshot/install.json) generated file.
Note that front-end module IDs begin with "`folio_`".

Its functionality should have already moved to other modules.
If still present, then verify that no other module depends upon it
(e.g. search the [Registry of ModuleDescriptors](/faqs/how-to-which-module-which-interface-endpoint/#registry-of-moduledescriptors)).

Raise a pull-request for [platform-complete snapshot](https://github.com/folio-org/platform-complete/tree/snapshot) branch.
Refer to the explanation of how the [platforms are constructed](/guidelines/release-procedures/#add-to-platforms) which describes the various branches and the key files and which ones are generated files.

The process will essentially be the reverse of when modules were initially [installed](/faqs/how-to-install-new-module/).
For front-end modules it should be straight-forward.
For back-end modules it could be more complex. If the module was included by virtue of being required by a front-end module, then it would be automatically removed when that module no longer requires it (on the next [hourly platform build](/guides/automation/#install-json)).
However some backend modules were added via the "install-extras.json" file (in the platform snapshot branch) either because they were not ever required by a frontend module, or the frontend was not yet ready and the entry was not removed from that file when the frontend finally was ready.

If the module was part of a previous Flower release, then raise a pull-request for [platform-complete master](https://github.com/folio-org/platform-complete/tree/master) branch (which will form the basis for the upcoming release).
The back-end modules will have an entry in the "install-extras.json" file (yes, its name is an artefact of the process).
The front-end modules will have an entry in the "package.json" and "stripes.config.js" as described via the previous paragraph.

## Remove from folio-ansible

This section explains a potential additional task related to back-end modules.
This task does not need to be synchronised with other tasks.

The "folio-snapshot" [reference environments](/guides/automation/#reference-environments) (and Vagrant box) are constructed using certain files in the platform-complete snapshot branch.
So after the module entries are removed, as described in the previous section, then they will be gone from those systems on their subsequent Jenkins build.

The "[folio-ansible/group_vars/snapshot](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible/blob/master/group_vars/snapshot)" file is used to supplement the module configuration.

Do search that file, as the module could be defined in two places.

Please send a pull-request for folio-ansible or [raise](/faqs/how-to-raise-devops-ticket/) a Jira ticket for FOLIO DevOps.

## Deal with outstanding PRs

Address outstanding pull requests for the GitHub repository, e.g. Close with a comment.

This is also a chance to delete any old merged branches, where developers forgot to [Maintain tidy repositories](/guides/tidy-repository/).

## Add notice section to README

Add a new section to the README with heading `DEPRECATED` to explain what happened.
Add this section after the copyright/license notice, and before the Introduction section.

See an example at [mod-bursar-export](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-bursar-export).

Also adjust the copyright year to match the last actual code commit.

## Adjust the About description

In the top-right panel of its GitHub front page is the "About" Description of the repository. This concise description is shown in various listings of repositories.

Adjust it to prepend a concise deprecation notice to the existing description.

See other examples by using the "Repositories" filter at the FOLIO Organization [Overview](https://github.com/folio-org).
Replace the default text "Find a repository" with "deprecated".

## Archive as read-only

At GitHub use the repository Settings: "Archive this repository -- Mark this repository as archived and read-only".

Review the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) before proceeding.

This will disable push access and pull requests. It leaves the teams configured, and can be temporarily reversed if needed. This also enables scripts to avoid “archived” repositories.

## Finalise

Add a comment to [FOLIO-1838](https://issues.folio.org/browse/FOLIO-1838).
This is a list of all archived modules.
