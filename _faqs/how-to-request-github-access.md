## GitHub new developer

For new developers, we ask that a project manager (see [Team vs module responsibility matrix](https://wiki.folio.org/display/REL/Team+vs+module+responsibility+matrix)) or at least a known existing developer, makes this request.

They need to either request on the #devops Slack channel, or raise a Jira ticket (especially with a group of new people, e.g. [FOLIO-2880](https://issues.folio.org/browse/FOLIO-2880).)

Provide the GitHub username (i.e. account name) of the new developer, so that we can be absolutely sure that we are inviting the correct person.
Provide a link to their GitHub profile page.

Specify which GitHub [Teams](https://github.com/orgs/folio-org/teams) to be allocated.

The new developer will need to follow the email and accept the invitation.

## GitHub team access

Note that we try to steer clear of managing GitHub access for individuals.
Instead allocate access for a whole [Team](https://github.com/orgs/folio-org/teams) to a repository.

Please clearly specify which team and which repository. It is more efficient for DevOps when you provide links to the team and repos.
