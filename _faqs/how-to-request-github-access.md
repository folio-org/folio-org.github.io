## GitHub new developer

For new developers (i.e. not yet a [member](https://github.com/orgs/folio-org/people) of "folio-org" organization) we ask that a project manager (see [Team and module responsibility matrix](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=14463134)) or at least a known existing developer, makes this request.

They need to either request on the #devops Slack channel, or [raise a FOLIO DevOps Jira ticket](/faqs/how-to-raise-devops-ticket/#general-folio-devops). Especially do the latter with a group of new people.

Please do not clone old tickets. It just tends to make a mess by applying old settings, and re-sending irrelevant old notifications.

Provide the GitHub username (i.e. account name) of the new developer, so that we can be absolutely sure that we are inviting the correct person.
Provide a link to their GitHub profile page, which is also a double-check that you are telling us the correct person.

Specify which GitHub [Teams](https://github.com/orgs/folio-org/teams) to be allocated.

The new developer will need to follow the email and accept the invitation.

## GitHub team access

Note that we try to steer clear of managing GitHub access for individuals,
and instead allocate access for a whole GitHub [Team](https://github.com/orgs/folio-org/teams) to a repository.

Please clearly specify which team and which repository. It is more efficient for DevOps when you provide links to the team and repos.

## Manage members for teams

The GitHub [Teams](https://github.com/orgs/folio-org/teams) each have a member who has the "Maintainer" role for that team.
They can add or remove existing members.
Of course, if the person is not yet a member of folio-org then follow the [new developer](#github-new-developer) instructions above.

If a team member leaves the FOLIO organization and will not further participate, then please contact DevOps as explained above, to remove their access.
