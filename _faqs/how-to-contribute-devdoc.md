## Introduction

This document is an overview about how to contribute to this [FOLIO Developers](/) website.
For example, edits to existing documentation, new documents, or raising Jira tickets.

Refer to the set of FAQs regarding [Developer documentation](/faqs/#developer-documentation).
In particular consider the principles about [Where is developer documentation located](/faqs/where-is-developer-documentation-located/).

## How it works

Refer to the section [About editing and publishing](/faqs/how-to-create-doc/#about-editing-and-publishing).

## Editing existing docs

The FAQ for [How to create a new document](/faqs/how-to-create-doc/#about-editing-and-publishing) has general notes about the structure of the Markdown documents, sections, generated table-of-contents, permalinks, etc.
(So those are not repeated here.)

All documents use GitHub Flavored Markdown [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

To locate the relevant existing document to edit, utilise the document URI (e.g. `guides/api-lint` and append the `.md` extension.

The set of FAQs are located in the `_faqs` directory, as [explained](/faqs/how-to-create-doc-faq/).

## Creating new docs

Follow the FAQs for new [/faqs/#developer-documentation](/faqs/#developer-documentation).

## Raising Jira tickets

See project [FOLIO](https://issues.folio.org/browse/FOLIO)
at the [FOLIO issue tracker](/guidelines/issue-tracker/).
We use the label "[devweb](https://issues.folio.org/issues/?jql=labels%3Ddevweb)" for items that relate to the software and facilities for building the website.
We use the label "[devdoc](https://issues.folio.org/issues/?jql=labels%3Ddevdoc)" for items that relate to documentation content.

Follow the instructions for [General FOLIO DevOps](/faqs/how-to-raise-devops-ticket/#general-folio-devops) tickets.
