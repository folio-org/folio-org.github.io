## General FOLIO DevOps

The main "FOLIO DevOps" team attends to the general development operations and infrastructure.

For general assistance, use the [Slack channel](/guidelines/which-forum/#slack) `#devops`.

For anything beyond simple assistance, please create a Jira ticket.
The DevOps teams are small and busy, so requests will need to be queued.

To raise Jira tickets, be familiar with the [Issue tracker overview](/guidelines/which-forum/#issue-tracker) and [Guidelines](/guidelines/issue-tracker/).

Use the Jira project key `FOLIO`.

Set the "Issue type" to be "Task".

Set the "Development Team" field to be [FOLIO DevOps](https://wiki.folio.org/display/FOLIJET/FOLIO+DevOps).

Set the "Sprint" field to be "DevOps Requests".

Do not set "Priority" or "Assignee" or "Labels" or a specific numbered "Sprint". Those will be handled and scheduled by the team.
