The on-line [API documentation](/reference/api/) explains the data that modules expect and return on their APIs.

Get help in the [FOLIO Slack](/guidelines/which-forum/#slack) #learning-apis channel.

To connect to the APIs there are several software options:

## curl

The [Okapi Guide](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md) has detailed examples and explanations how to use APIs with command-line tool `curl`.

## okapi-curl

The [okapi-curl](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/okapi-curl) is a shell script that wraps curl.

## Okapi CLI

The [okapi-cli](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi-cli) is a command-line interface written in Java.

## OkapiClient

The [OkapiCLI.py](https://gitlab.lrz.de/bib-public/okapiclient) is a command-line interface written in Python.

## Stripes CLI

The [stripes-cli](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli) is a command-line interface written in JavaScript that can connect to back-end APIs and help front-end developers that use FOLIO's User Interface framework Stripes.

## Postman

The [folio-api-tests Github repository](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-api-tests) contains Postman collections for the APIs of some FOLIO modules. Use them with Postman or Newman.

## Insomnia

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
