The on-line [API documentation](/reference/api/) explains the data that modules expect and return on their APIs.

To connect to the APIs there are several software options:

## curl

The [Okapi Guide](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md) has detailed examples and explanations how to use APIs with command-line tool `curl`.

## Okapi CLI

The [okapi-cli](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi-cli) is a command-line interface written in Java.

## OkapiClient

The [OkapiCLI.py](https://gitlab.lrz.de/bib-public/okapiclient) is a command-line interface written in Python.

## Stripes CLI

The [stripes-cli](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli) is a command-line interface written in JavaScript that can connect to back-end APIs and help front-end developers that use FOLIO's User Interface framework Stripes.

## Postman

The [folio-api-tests Github repository](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-api-tests) contains Postman collections for the APIs of some FOLIO modules. Use them with Postman or Newman. Get help in the [FOLIO Slack](https://wiki.folio.org/display/COMMUNITY/FOLIO+Communication+Spaces#FOLIOCommunicationSpaces-slackSlack) #postman channel.
