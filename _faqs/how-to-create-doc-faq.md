To add a new FAQ to this dev.folio.org site, follow these guidelines.
There are separate guidelines for creating a new [regular document](/faqs/how-to-create-doc/) which also has advice about editing and publishing the changes.

Copy an existing file in the [\_faqs](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-org.github.io/tree/master/_faqs) directory.
Follow the established filename convention and titles scheme.
The filename forms the URL of the FAQ page.
Choose carefully, so as to not break URLs in the future.

Allocate one or more `categories` in its frontmatter.
These are defined in the file `_data/faqs.yml`

Adjust the `faqOrder` in its frontmatter.
This defines the explicit order of entries within a section of the generated [all FAQs](/faqs/) index page.
If there are multiple entries with the same number, then the sub-order is alphabetic by filename.
A high number (e.g. 100) will ensure that this entry is always at the end of the section.

The list of [all FAQs](/faqs/) is automatically generated.
