# Hosting a Jekyll-based website on AWS, with branch support

## AWS CloudFormation Configuration Files
* [website-master](website-master_cloudformation.yml): Stack of the fundamental components for hosting the website, including the GitHub hook user, the CloudFront distribution, and the S3 bucket hosting the master branch of the site.
* [website-branch](website-branch_cloudformation.yml): Stack of the AWS components needed to host a branch of the website.

## Parameters
Each of these are parameters to the `website-master_cloudformation.yml` file.
In each numbered line, the CloudFormation variable name is listed at the beginning.
1. `WebsiteCFNArtifactsBucket`: S3 bucket for holding artifacts required for the CloudFormation stack (e.g. the AWS Lambda code)
2. `WebsiteDNSName`: DNS name where the website will be located
3. `GitHubWebsiteRepoURL`: URL to the git repository located on GitHub.com
4. `GitHubHookUserName`: Name of the AWS IAM user that will be used on GitHub as the recipient of GitHub Webhook messages

## Stack Creation Process
1. Create a private S3 bucket to contain to contain the AWS Lambda code and other artifacts of the website build process.  Name the bucket something like `dev-website-cloudformation-artifacts`; the name of this bucket is the `WebsiteCFNArtifactsBucket` parameter
1. Create a ZIP file of the Lambda code: `cd GitHubHook-Lambda && zip -g GitHubHook-Lambda.zip GitHubHook.py && cd -`
1. Upload the Lambda code to the private S3 bucket.  For instance, this AWS CLI command: `aws --profile <profile_name> s3 cp GitHubHook-Lambda/GitHubHook-Lambda.zip s3://dev-website-cloudformation-artifacts`
1. Upload `website-branch_cloudformation.yml` to the same bucket: `aws --profile <profile_name> s3 cp website-branch_cloudformation.yml s3://dev-website-cloudformation-artifacts`
