This is an initial guide to available sysadmin and deployment resources.

The [Okapi Guide and Reference](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md) provides the necessary background understanding,
especially the
[Running in cluster mode](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#running-in-cluster-mode) section,
and the [Securing Okapi](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#securing-okapi) section with its linked detail.

The [folio-install](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-install) repository provides an initial collection of runbooks for FOLIO installation, such as
[kubernetes-rancher](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-install/tree/master/alternative-install/kubernetes-rancher)
(see also [Kubernetes example](https://docs.folio.org/docs/getting-started/installation/kubernetesex/)).

The [Systems Operations and Management SIG](https://wiki.folio.org/display/SYSOPS/Systems+Operations+and+Management+SIG+Home) (SysOps special interest group)
has various notes about deployment environments, orchestration, hosting environments, data migration, and notes about test installations by SIG members.

The [Slack](/guidelines/which-forum/#slack) `#folio-sys-ops` and `#folio-devops` channels.
