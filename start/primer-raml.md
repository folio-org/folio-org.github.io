As explained in the [Primer for back-end development](/start/primer-develop-backend/) the _RAML Module Builder (RMB)_ framework can be utilised to ease development. One of its abilities is to generate Java classes from the RAML and Schema.

RAML and schema files are also utilised in other ways,
for example the Okapi [Web service](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#web-service) and [Tenant interface](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#tenant-interface), the [mod-graphql](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql/tree/master/src/autogen),
and by other non-RMB modules.

The RMB README section entitled [Design the RAML files](https://github.com/folio-org/raml-module-builder#step-6-design-the-raml-files) provides some RMB-specific guidance, as well as general assistance.

The mod-graphql [Autogeneration of GraphQL schemas and resolvers](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql/tree/master/src/autogen) document explains the RAML and Schema files.

The RMB README has an example and commentary.

As explained there, use the shared git submodule at `ramls/raml-util` and follow the ideal [directory structure](/guides/commence-a-module/#back-end-ramls).
See notes about thereafter [updating](/guides/developer-setup/#update-git-submodules) submodules.

When using RMB, it is important to further emphasise some items.
Pay attention to the "$ref" used to reference and link the [JSON Schema](/guides/commence-a-module/#back-end-api-schema).
For RAML-0.8 and RMB prior to v20, there must be at least two endpoints, and all schema that are used must be declared in the RAML file.

Use "[api-lint](/guides/api-lint/)" to assess API definitions, schema, and examples.
A script is provided, to find files and run it.
That script is also utilised by the continuous-integration.

[Describe schema and properties](/guides/describe-schema/).

Investigate the other raml-using [server-side](/source-code/#server-side) modules.
The [mod-notes](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-notes) is a compact exemplar.

[Reference API documentation](/reference/api/)
is automatically generated by the continuous integration,
for modules that are managed with the FOLIO CI.
