Start with introduction to [user interface](/guides/#user-interface)
and the [client-side](/source-code/#client-side) source code repositories.

That leads to the Stripes [documentation](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/README.md) and overview of the main docs, and necessary background understanding.
That overview leads to various other documentation, including the
[stripes-components](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-components) 
(with its accompanying [Storybook](https://folio-org.github.io/stripes-components) generated documentation)
and
[stripes-smart-components](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-smart-components) -- both have documentation in their "lib" directory for each component.
Also consider that for some Stripes components, it might be suitable to use a [Stripes plugin](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/dev-guide.md#plugins).

The foundation described in
[The Stripes Module Developer's Guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/dev-guide.md) is necessary for developing UI modules using Stripes.

Watch the [Stripes overview](/community/events/#stripes-coburn-2018-08) presentation.

Then follow Wiki [Developing UI Modules with Stripes](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/x/DQBpCQ) and [Creating a new development setup for Stripes](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/new-development-setup.md) and the [Stripes: quick start](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/quick-start.md) and the guide to [Running a local FOLIO system](/guides/run-local-folio/) for guidance to establish your local FOLIO work environment.

Then move on to creating a real module with the help of [stripes-cli](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli)
and in particular the [App development](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#app-development) section.

The [Commence a module - structure and configuration](/guides/commence-a-module/) guide explains a consistent layout for a front-end module,
together with the guidelines to [Create a new FOLIO module and do initial setup](/guidelines/create-new-repo/).

The guide to [User experience design](/guides/user-experience-design/) provides guidelines and tools for building accessible apps.

Refer to [How to run tests prior to commit](/faqs/how-to-test-prior-to-commit/) for brief explanation and links to testing facilities.
