As explained in the [Primer for back-end development](/start/primer-develop-backend/) there are various supporting libraries which can be utilised to ease development with OpenAPI.

FOLIO currently uses OpenAPI ([OAS](/reference/glossary/#oas)) version 3.0

Use "[api-lint](/guides/api-lint/)" to assess API descriptions, schema, and examples.
A script is provided, to find files and run it.
That script can be run locally, and is also utilised by the continuous-integration.

[Describe schema and properties](/guides/describe-schema/).

Use "[api-doc](/guides/api-doc/)" to generate documentation from the API descriptions, schema, and examples.
That script can be run locally, and is also utilised by the continuous-integration to build the [FOLIO API documentation](/reference/api/).

Investigate the other OpenAPI-using [server-side](/source-code/#server-side) modules.

[Reference API documentation](/reference/api/)
is automatically generated by the continuous integration,
for modules that are managed with the FOLIO CI.
